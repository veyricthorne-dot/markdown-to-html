# Tic Tac Toe Web Application

## Overview
This is a simple, responsive Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Designed for two players to enjoy on the same device, it features clear turn indicators, win and draw detection, and a reset button for new games.

## Setup
To run the game, simply save the above code into a file named `index.html`. No additional setup or dependencies are required beyond an internet connection to load Tailwind CSS and Marked.js via CDN.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in your web browser. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marks ('X' or 'O'). The game will automatically detect wins or draws and update the status message accordingly. Use the "Reset Game" button to start a new round at any time.
